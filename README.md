# Dotfiles

Personal macOS and Arch/Omarchy configuration for Bash, Zsh, Neovim, Herdr,
tmux, terminal emulators, and desktop tools.

## Install

```sh
git clone git@github.com:teddyhwang/dotfiles.git ~/src/github.com/teddyhwang/dotfiles
cd ~/src/github.com/teddyhwang/dotfiles
./setup.sh
```

The setup is idempotent and can be run from any working directory. Existing
files are kept unless replacement is confirmed; confirmed replacements are
moved to `~/.local/state/dotfiles/backups/replaced.*/` rather than deleted.
Targets with traversal segments or parents resolving outside HOME are refused.
On macOS, setup uses `Brewfile.work` when `devx` is available as a command;
otherwise it uses the personal `Brewfile`. Missing dependencies are installed
with `--no-upgrade`; workstation-wide upgrades are intentionally left as a
separate maintenance action.

### Supported systems

- **macOS:** Homebrew packages, app configuration, launch agents, and shared
  shell/editor configuration.
- **Arch/Omarchy Linux:** `pacman`/`yay` packages, Hyprland, keyd, Omarchy, and
  shared shell/editor configuration.

Linux T2 suspend support requires an explicit privileged run after the normal
user setup:

```sh
sudo ./scripts/macbook_t2_linux.sh
```

## Validate

```sh
./scripts/check.sh
```

This runs shell syntax checks, ShellCheck, structured-config parsing, Python and
Lua compilation checks when available, and the Node test suite. GitHub Actions
runs the same check on Linux and macOS. Validation needs Node 24+, Python 3.11+,
Ruby with `YAML.safe_load_file`, jq, ShellCheck, Bash, and Zsh. Neovim and tmux enable
additional isolated integration tests.

Measure warm startup locally (no cache deletion or dependency installation):

```sh
python3 scripts/benchmark.py --runs 21
```

This measures startup plus immediate exit, without a TTY. It does not measure
first-prompt readiness, deferred plugins, or LSP initialization.

## Maintenance

`Brewfile` is the curated personal package list. `Brewfile.work` is a
generated snapshot of everything installed through Homebrew on the work Mac.
During `setup.sh`, an available `devx` command selects `Brewfile.work`; without
`devx`, setup selects `Brewfile`. Refreshing the snapshot never changes the
personal file.

```sh
# Refresh the work Mac snapshot from the current machine
./scripts/backup_brewfile.sh

# Restore the generated snapshot on another Mac
brew bundle install --file ./Brewfile.work

# Install anything newly added to the personal Brewfile without upgrading everything
brew bundle install --no-upgrade --file ./Brewfile

# Deliberately upgrade managed personal Homebrew dependencies
brew bundle upgrade --file ./Brewfile

# Start heavyweight development services only when needed
brew services start postgresql@14 # or mysql@8.4, redis, ollama

# Update Neovim plugins, then review and commit lazy-lock.json
nvim '+Lazy update'
```

The backup script records taps, formulae, casks, and any Mac App Store entries
that Homebrew Bundle can detect. It excludes VS Code extensions and global Go,
Cargo, uv, and npm packages so `Brewfile.work` remains a Homebrew inventory.
The snapshot is generated without package-description comments to keep updates
easy to review in Git.

macOS launch-agent setup is separate from package installation and runs after
binaries are linked. Re-running `scripts/services_mac.sh` also repairs unloaded
managed jobs. Clipboard agents remain opt-in. tmux plugin installation uses a
private, sessionless server and checks every declared plugin without touching
your active tmux sessions.

Database servers and Ollama are installed but deliberately not enabled at
login by this setup. Previously enabled services are not stopped automatically. `home/config/nvim/lazy-lock.json` is committed so a fresh machine gets the same
plugin revisions. Generated theme files, caches, machine-local configuration,
and secret-bearing environment files are ignored. Never add credentials to the
repository; use the system keychain, 1Password, or untracked local environment
files instead.
